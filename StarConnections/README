//This program finds the 6-degrees of seperation between actors as well as finding
//the number of actors at each degree of seperation for a given actor.

//In order to find the shortest path between two actors run by typing:
	'python3 six-degrees.py path thespians-cleaned.txt 1000'


//In order to find the number of actors at each degree of seperation for a given
//actor type:
	'python3 six-degrees.py bfs thespians-cleaned.txt 1000'


//This program implements a graph data structure and uses Depth First and Breadth
//first search in order to find the shortest path and the number of actors at
//each degree of seperation.
